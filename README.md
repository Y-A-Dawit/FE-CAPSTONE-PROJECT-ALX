# SimpleHabitTracker – A Simple Habit Tracker Web App

## Project Description

SimpleHabitTracker is a minimalist habit tracking web app built as part of the ALX Front-End Capstone Project. The app is designed to help users create, manage, and track daily habits in a clean and simple interface. It combines a single HTML entry point with modular React components, all styled using vanilla CSS. Data is stored in the browser using localStorage, ensuring habits persist across sessions. The project also includes a landing page, dashboard, profile page, and an about page that introduces the developer and the motivation behind the project.
